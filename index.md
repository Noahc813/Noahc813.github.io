## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 4, Part 1
    This was a very interesting lab for me as we had the objective of converting units from the metric system in the US customary system. This was the lab where I learned how to use different variables on VS code such as the necessary ‘double’ that is used for numbers with decimals that made the conversion process much easier. We also learned it made it easier for the compiling process. Although it was very straightforward being one of the first labs I found it very interesting and enjoyed working on it.

Lab 6, Part 2
    This was also close to being my favorite lab as I loved playing blackjack with my father when I was younger so writing a program I went home to show him and we played it virtually. In this lab we had a big factor of input validation with the correct number of arguments which since we learned in the lectures and reading was no problem but did become a problem for me in later labs.

Lab 7, Part 1
    This was my favorite lab as we had the objective of doing a date difference of the Gregorian and the Julian calendar such as a previous lab but this lab taught us to simplify  from prompting each individual value into using the command line for the start and end dates altogether.  This lab was a bit difficult to understand for me and my partner. We had issues remembering to use the correct amount of arguments muc like lab 6 but once we figured it out we had a huge satisfying feeling that puts this lab as my number one.
